It sorts your files each in a folder named as its extension.
It's very helpful to sort Download folder.

Inspired by [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/tks369/oc_wrote_a_simple_python_script_to_organize_messy/)


## Usage
You can use it as a simple PowerShell script.
Alternatively you can put OrdinaPS.ps1 in a script folder, set an Enviroment Variable named "Scripts" (a Googled tutorial [here](https://turbolab.it/windows-10/guida-windows-10-come-modificare-variabile-sistema-path-aggiungere-cartella-percorso-directory-variabile-ambiente-2560) and add it to you context menu with Add-to-context-menu.reg file.
